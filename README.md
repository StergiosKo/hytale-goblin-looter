# hytale-goblin-looter
Custom NPCs for the game Hytale. They are agile treasure hording goblins who drop generous loot and a chance for a portal to travel to their lands.

# Info
They are temporary based of the unused Goblin_Thief template already existing in the hytale game files. Existing bugs of the original behavior are fixed, and its behavior will be altered, along with the model of the NPC.

# Credits
Huge thanks to DarkWolf_XP for creating a tutorial and template for the system portals.
